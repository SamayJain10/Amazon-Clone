            Custom Apple silicon makes Apple Watch Series 9 more capable, intuitive and faster. The dual-core CPU has 5.6 billion transistors — 60% more than the S8 chip. A 4-core Neural Engine processes machine learning tasks up to two times faster. It enables a number of innovations, including the double tap gesture.

            <h2>Why Apple Watch Series 9</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Watches out for your heart.</strong> With the ECG app, Apple Watch Series 9 is capable of generating an ECG similar to a single‑lead electrocardiogram. And with the Heart Rate app, you can get notifications for high and low heart rate as well as an irregular rhythm</li>
              <li><strong>Dream machine.</strong> The Sleep app doesn’t just keep track of your time asleep. It shows you how much time you spent in REM, Core or Deep sleep, as well as when you might have woken up.</li>
              <li><strong>Understand your cycle like never before.</strong> Apple Watch Series 9 has an innovative sensor that tracks your temperature while you sleep, so you can see changes over time. Cycle Tracking uses this data to provide a retrospective estimate of when you likely ovulated, which can be helpful for family planning.</li>
              <li><strong>Log your state of mind.</strong> In the Mindfulness app on Apple Watch, scroll through engaging visuals to help you select how you’re feeling to log your momentary emotion and daily mood. Stay consistent with notifications and complications on your watch face.</li>
